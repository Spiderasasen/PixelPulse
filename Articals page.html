                <p class="center">Even though I am working on this project for my personal growth, there might be others who need help in learning how to code. To grasp these amazing coding languages, I recommend enrolling in a coding school. If that's not feasible financially, there are numerous great coding resources accessible online. You can kickstart your coding adventure with excellent programming areas available here. All you require to commence coding is a compiler, also provided here. While starting shouldn't be overly challenging, here are some resources to assist you.</p>

Despite the associated cost, I recommend it because of its free features. If you wish to challenge yourself further, you can opt for a premium membership. However, I suggest practicing by inputting familiar code into a compiler, avoiding over-creativity, and creating an easy-to-learn but challenging blackjack game in Python. This platform provides instruction in various programming languages, including C++, Java, and Python, alongside HTML and CSS. It stands as one of the premier coding courses for learning.</p>

What a wealth of knowledge you offer. From imparting historical lessons to illustrating the significance of mathematics and science. While Khan Academy is renowned for these subjects, it also stands as one of the best platforms for learning how to code. It offers not only the most commonly used languages such as Python and Java but also more niche ones like Ruby, which can be challenging to master. Khan Academy is truly versatile in its offerings.</p>

It hosts two major coding languages, especially if you are interested in web development. These languages, such as HTML and JavaScript, are basically the fundamental building blocks that make the internet the way it is. It was one of the first tools that aided me in learning and understanding JavaScript. Yes, my initial coding language was JavaScript, and I have wonderful memories of all the tests and apps that I created using the power of JavaScript.</p>
